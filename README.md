# Eventmaker tech interview

## Getting started with the command line and git

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a powerful distibuted version control system. At Eventmaker we work exclusively with Git and [Github](https://github.com/).

The first step of this interview is to clone this repository onto your computer using a terminal. Once cloned a new directory will be created. Go inside the directory, you are on the **master** branch. Git uses a branching model that is [described here](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches).

For this interview you will work not on the **master** branch (we never do that ðŸ˜Š) but on a branch that will contain your work only. Go ahead and create a new branch name `eventmaker-interview`.

* a Terminal (with how my zsh ?)

Test duration is about 1h, the candidate can use internet and look for answers. He may also ask questions any time he/she wants.

To start the test make this repo public and let the candidate clone it. **This repo should be made private again at the en of the test**.
