## Write some code ... in react :)

Go into the `react` folder of this project and then run :

- `npm install` (this will install dependencies)
- `npm start` (this will start a webserver)

This app is a simple TODO app. You can add a TODO and delete a TODO. You have to change this code so the TODO are not text anymore but images. For example, if you copy paste this : `https://media.mnn.com/assets/images/2018/07/cat_eating_frozen_treat.jpg.653x0_q80_crop-smart.jpg` in the input, the image should be displayed on the page :

<img src="./example.png"/>

If the input is not a an image, a simple text should be displayed. For example if I input "buy some tomatoes", I wan't to see thee text and not a broken image.
